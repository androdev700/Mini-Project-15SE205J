This mini project aims to deploy real-world flight booking system. The flight booking system is a complex process involving different stages. This project uses Object oriented concepts to design and code a simpler version of the model. The project is so designed as can be extended further to accommodate more complex functionalities.
Separate classes for Payment, File handling and Login/Signup is used. Data such as existing users, city names, flight list, booked tickets are stored in text files for permanent storage.
Although this project is a simpler execution of real-world flight booking model, it can easily be extended further after reading Documentation.

OBJECT ORIENTED CONCEPTS USED -
• Inheritance - class Login extends Portal
• Abstraction - class SignUp , class Ticket, void printDetails()
• Encapsulation - class FileHandler, classes’ data members have setters and getters 
• Polymorphism-voidprepPayment()

JAVA CONCEPTS USED -
• File Handling
• Classes and Objects
• Interface
• Exception Handling Threading Collections SRM UNIVERSITY
